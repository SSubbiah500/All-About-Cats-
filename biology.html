    <p class = "bio"> 
    The cat is the only domesticated member of the Felidae family which also includes lions and tigers. Like all members of Felidae, they have long tails and sharp teeth and claws to aid them in hunting. Cats are flexible creatures because unlike humans, their vetebrae is held together by muscles instead of ligaments. 
    </p>
    <h3>Eyes</h3>
    <p class = "bio"> 
    Cats have a third eyelid called a <em>nictitating membrane</em> which protects the eye. Cats are nocturnal animals. Their eye muscles often constrict in bright environments and expand in dark ones to allow a certain amount of light to enter the iris. Behind the cat's retina, there is a layer called the <em>tapetum lucidum</em> which reflects light. People see this reflection in their cat when its eyes start glowing. 
    </p>
    <h3>Whiskers</h3>
    <p class = "bio"> 
    A cat's whiskers are much thicker than their fur and they are very sensiitve. The base a whisker as a sensory organ called a proprioceptor which sends messages to the brain. The whiskers help the cat sense what its limbs are doing. Cats have good farsightedness but can't see objects well up close. Their whiskers send information about up-close objects straight to the brain, almost like a detector. They also let the brain know where its limbs are, enabling the cat to always land on its feet when they fall. 
    </p>
    <h3>Paws</h3>
    <p class = "bio">Cats actually have 18 toes. The back paws have four toes while the front contain an extra toe that never touches the ground called a dewclaw. Every paw has a skin pad which protect the feet and help the cat determine the temperature of a certain surface. Unlike humans, cats walk on the tips of their toes. This kind of walk is called <em>digitigrade walking</em>. This kind of walking also enabled cats to be more stealthy so they could catch prey. 
    The paws of a cat also contain scent glands. Whenver a cat scratches the floor or an object, their scent glands secrete a scent which helps the cat mark it as their own. </p>
    
    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
    <p class = "bio">
        Cats are able to reproduce around nine months into their lifetimes. A cat's pregnancy lasts about 63 days. During this time, each kitten develops in its own thick amniotic sack. After a kitten is born, the mother will rip the umbilical cord and tear the amniotic sack. Then she starts cleaning each kitten. Kittens are extremely vulnerable after birth and only depend on their mothers. The average cat will have a litter of four kittens but this varies depending on breed.
