    <h3>Natural History</h3>
    <p class = "history"> 
    Today's cats are most likely descendants of wildcats called <em>Felis Silvestris</em>. They were first domesticated by humans about 10,000 years ago in the Middle East as advances in agriculture caused surpluses of food and also...rodents. As humans started exploring and traveling around the world by boat, cats were often taken with them to keep the rodent population at bay. 
    However, cats didn't truly become household pets until the 1930s and were merely considered "rodent killers." Innovations in spaying and neutering during the 30s enabled humans to keep cats inside during mating season. By the 1950s, two new inventions called kitty litter and cat food arose. This meant cats no longer had to hunt for their food and humans were able to keep them inside without worrying about how to clean up after them.
